Galaxia — Recreating the Classic Galaxian Game

Description:
Galaxia is a recreation of the classic Galaxian arcade game, built in C++ using the SDL library. The project emphasizes applying Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and optimizing performance through efficient data structures and algorithms.

## Features

Object-Oriented Design: applied inheritance, polymorphism, and pointers.
2D Gameplay: player movement, shooting mechanics, and enemy AI.
Audio & Graphics: SDL2 image, mixer, and TTF libraries for textures, sound effects, and fonts.
Optimized Performance: efficient algorithms and data structures.
Maintainable Code: modular structure with multiple header/source files.

## Technologies Used

C++
SDL2 Core (graphics, input handling)
SDL2_image (loading images)
SDL2_mixer (sound/music)
SDL2_ttf (text rendering)
OOP Principles (inheritance, polymorphism)

## Project Structure

main.cpp → Entry point
src/ → C++ source files (game logic, player, enemies, etc.)
include/ → Header files (class definitions)
